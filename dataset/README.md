To train the model, [`Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, 8th edition`](./Introduction_to_Mathematical_Statistics.pdf) is utilized.  
For fine-tuning the YOLO model, we employ the [<ins> **Roboflow**</ins>](https://roboflow.com/) website to prepare the data.  
The data prepared by Roboflow for fine-tuning the YOLO v7 model is accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F8mX5Y9ODuwnhWsEsZtayOrUa1i6FhXt?usp=sharing).
